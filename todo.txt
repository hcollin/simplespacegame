TODO for HC:

Ship Designer

- Change turnProcessor so that it searches design from faction.
    - When unit is being built the copy of the unit is immediately created, so that if the design is removed before the command is completed it does not crash.
- Megaton of ship part balancing, currently completely out of whack
- Make the designer look even remotely adequate, currently looks like a bad engineer version

New Tech Tree

- Design what all techs do
- Code the technologies into the code.
