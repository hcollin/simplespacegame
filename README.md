# SIMPLE STARS

This should become an simple turn based space strategy game, where players will conquer star systems, fight with each other and maybe even make alliances

## Winning the game

The game is won by fullfilling N amount of objectives. In the MVP the objectives are simply to control certain Systems at the same time. Each player has 2 secret objectives and there are 5 public objetives for each faction ot fullfill. First to 5 objectives wins the game.

## What to do during the game

Each player starts with one star system and one a small fleet of ships. Each turn they can give 5 commands. These commands can be given to systems or ships and then there are some more general commands. Maybe.

* System commands
  * Build units (Up to the maximum cap of the industrial value of the system)
  * Improve industry (increate the industry value of the planet by 1)
  * Improve economy (increase the money generated by the planet by 1)
  * Improve defences (increase the defence value of the planet by 1)
  * Improve welfare (increase the welfare value of the planet by 1)
* Fleet commands
 * Move (unless already on route)
 * Invade / Colonize
 * Defend (Gives a bonus to the fleet for defending the system it is placed)
* General
 * Claim objective

Player can only give one command to unit per turn, but multiple commands can be given to a single system, up to their command limit.


## Systems

Each system has 4 different charasteristics that can be improved: Industry, Economy, Defence and Welfare. They can also have some spacialities in the future, but for the MVP they are all identical each home system starts with 3 on each value and each new planet has 0.

### Industry

Each ship build requires certain level of industry points. More industry points the systems has, more and bigger ships it can build.

### Economy

Each improvment and ship will require money to build and that money is produced by the economy value in the sytem

### Defences

When under attack the system have defences setup. The more defences it has, then easier it is to actually defend it.

### Welfare

Increasing welfare increases the command cap of the system and the total command count player can give each turn is based on the total welfare of all the systems player has

## Units and fleets

Player produces units and units that move together or are located on a single system are considered a fleet.

Each unit has the following base values: Weapons, Hull and Speed. Each unit can also have some basic keywords attached to them that can affect their combat or other values.

### Units

There are X units in the game in the first iteration of it each with certain values (W/H/S/IndReq/Cost/Keywords)

Destroyer (1/2/4/1/4/)
Cruiser (2/4/4/2/4/)
Battleship (4/10/3/5/8/"INVASION")
Colony Ship (1/4/2/3/6/"COLONY")

## Combat

This is the MVP combat system. It is extremely simple and straightforward and pretty just about dumb luck. Much elegant system is needed.

When two hostile forces meet in the system ther is a battle. Battle is resolved by both sides "rolling" a pool dice equal to the total Weapons they have. Each result of 7 or over causes 1 damaage that is assigned to the weakest ship in the enemy fleet. If the hits exceeds the ships hull, that ship is destroyed and removed from the combat. These rolls will continue until only one side is left.


# Tech

List of ideas for tech

* Ship tech
  * Movement speed
  * Combat roll adjustment
  * Combat rerolls
  * More hull
  * Shields that allows us to take more hits.
  * Cost reduction
  * Indestry requirement reduction
* Economy
  * More money per economy point
* Industry
  * Reduce the cost of industry
  * Automatic industry on new planets
* Defense
  * Better rolls for defense
  * Cheaper defense (first 2 are free)
* Welfare
  * Less tech reduction
  * Faster Actions 1 per 8
  * Cheaper welfare
* Other more special tech
  * Shoot one round before other player (without this tech)
  * Automatic increase in economy for every three turns
  * Slow the speed of enemy ships close to your system
  * Automatic research point per turn
  * More Research levels adjustment levels
  * Less destruction on invasion


# Objectives

For now: Control 5 ring worlds

# Diplomacy

Diplomacy provides a simple messaging/chat tool between factions. Those messages will transfer immediately
Actual trades happen on turn processing and require a command
